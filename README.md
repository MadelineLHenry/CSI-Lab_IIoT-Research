Project Summary: Industrial IoT Factory Automation Test Bed

Collaborated with the Connected Systems Institute, a prestigious Center of Excellence for Research & Development at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, to drive process improvement within an industrial IoT factory automation test bed. The project aimed to identify and capitalize on opportunities for enhanced efficiency and productivity.

Utilizing a fully functioning, AI-based manufacturing cell that tracked quality, performance, and raw material usage, the project centered around thorough data analysis. The data obtained served as the foundation for identifying key insights and driving informed decision-making.

The project successfully achieved the development of a predictive model using feature selection methods and an ensemble Random Forest Classifier. This model demonstrated an impressive 92% accuracy in determining the pass or fail outcome of individual vials at inspection stations. Such precision enabled swift intervention and optimization of the manufacturing process.

Continuing the project's progression, later iterations focused on leveraging computer vision techniques to accurately classify the fill-level of vials within the test bed. This advanced analysis further enhanced the understanding of product quality control and enabled proactive measures to be taken to ensure optimal performance.

Overall, the project showcased the ability to leverage cutting-edge technologies and data-driven techniques to improve manufacturing processes and achieve superior quality control.
